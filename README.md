Final project GritAcademyAPI by Rositsa Nikolova
for the purpose of the course Java Web Services, Grit Academy Malm√∂ 2024.

For the project were used materials by the course instructor Lukas that could be found here https://github.com/LukasKurasinski/testSpringBootTwo/tree/master
For the starting layer of the project was used the course Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners at Udemy by Chad Darby
For the Many to Many resolve was used Youtube sources
And a huge thank you to the internet for resolving before my time many of the problems that I encountered. 

JPArepository and CRUDrepository are not used here because of my need to have a bit more control and understanding of what happens behind the scenes. For that was used almost entirely Entity manager with written queries. 
The project paths were tested with Postman especially for Delete and Post.
